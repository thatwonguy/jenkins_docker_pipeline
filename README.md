jenkins docker cicd pipeline set up

1. Jenkins uses java so need to install java jdk on your local machine and then also download and install jenkins properly. Figure that out and then once its installed, go to your `cmd` and run the following to  get jenkins running on your local depending on where you installed it and saved it on your computer (keep track of that).
    ```
    java -jar "C:\Program Files\Jenkins\jenkins.war"
    ```
